# A list of things useful to owners of the GPD Win Max 2

# A check list of things to check on a new device
###### Credits to SuperSexySoapTurtle#6606 on discord.
1. Test gpu under load for black screen. (Use graphically heavy games, 3dmark, photoshop, etc.)
2. Check bios version to make sure its up to date (Only update if necessary, see #1)
3. Test all keyboard keys (A lot of people are having issues with missed inputs) If you're having issues, try putting tape under the keycap
4. Test analog deadzones and [update firmware](https://www.mediafire.com/file/2lqucxtobzk0wfc/GPD_Gamepad_Firmware_Tool%25288%2529.exe/file) if needed
5. Test for static shock (Some dude was getting shocked by his unit occasionally lmao)
6. Look for dead pixels
7. Test if micro sd & sd card can be read. A lot of users were having issues with it disconnecting and reconnecting. This problem doesn't immediately show up, so if you use  SD and Micro SD a lot, I would monitor this.
8. Touch screen deadzones. Make sure all corners of the screen can be touched correctly. (I'd recommend touching and dragging each corner on the desktop to test this)
9. Make sure touch pad isn't going insane. (If it is, install [firmware update](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QlJEQPft1qemrM8F5jseteMwCc7-kVY_/view) from gpd)
10. Make sure screen is glued correctly (Some dude could see into his unit through a gap in the upper half of the screen lmao)
11. Do a full scan for malware with Microsoft defender. It should catch whatever worm or virus if any. Or just reinstall OS if you aren't lazy like me.
12. [Test analog stick circularity.](https://gamepad-tester.com/)
13. Make sure keycaps don't have cracks in them.
14. Make sure Dpad is working correctly.
15. Make sure remote play is working correctly. (A user was having issues with the screen randomly going black and having to force the machine to shut down.)

# Useful information
1. For chargers, it MUST support AT LEAST PD3.0 15v 3A to trickle charge, but the OS might force your TDP down when plugged in to a charger like that to try to ensure the battery gets charged, a charger that support 20v is heavily recommanded for use while the device is under load(eg. gaming while plugged in), 20v 3A is good enough to play games and charge at the same time, but with a 20v 5A charger and e-marked cable it will be faster if the TDP is high and you are loading the device heavily.
2. All WM2 comes with the same PD 20v 5A charger with a 1 meter cable in box, the charger uses the Chinese/US two prong plug and comes with an adapter for your region if your plug is different.
3a. The included charger have been tested to be safe for both you and the device, the switching frequency is around 100kHz and a quick power analysis have been done to test the voltage ripple under full 20v 5A load with the results coming out at around 110mVp-p at 20MHz BW limit.<br/>

3c. Included charger under full 100w load, note the voltage drop is due to the cable used in the test and due to using a two point measurement instead of a four point measurement, the voltage drop is the same for other power supplies when running the same two point measurement.<br/>

# Known issues
1. Some specific charger would cause the WM2 to lower its TDP when plugged in.
2. On some units the SD card slots will constantly disconnet and reconnect rendering it unuseable.(See below for workaround)
3. Display out on hubs plugged into the USB 3.2 slot doesn't work and lock the resolution to 800x600
4. Some spacebars doesn't trigger consistently. (See below for workaround)
5. Some units have erratic touchpads and registers random touches.(See below for potential fix)
6. Some Bitrates and Sample Rates for the built-in DAC are sometimes missing on windows.(See below for fix) 

# Workarounds
###### SD card slots disconneting constantly workaround, credits to ciphray#8122 on discord for the workaround, credits to Xryptic#5251 on discord for the instructions.<br/>
For anyone having SD/MicroSD disconnect/reconnect issues, the wonderful Ciphray has found a temporary solution that will work until GPD comes up with a fix. It lowers your SD readers speeds to USB 2.0 speeds, but they will stop having problems.
1. Shut your WM2 down
2. Boot and press delete until you enter the bios screen
3. Hold ALT and press F5 to see advanced BIOS
4. Go to Chipset > South Bridge > SB USB Configuration > USB1 Ports
5. Change XHC1 Port 1 to “Disabled”
6. Save and exit BIOS
###### Workaround for inconsistent spacebar, credits to zero3growlithe#2048 on discord.
1. Detach the spacebar keycap (find tutorial on YT for laptop keyboards in general, the principle is the same) - be very careful!
2. Under the keycap, right in the center, stick a small piece of 1mm thick tape
3. Attach the keycap back to the keyboard
4. Enjoy!
###### Potential fix for touchpad issues.

###### Fix for missing Bitrates and Sample Rates for built-in DAC, credits to Goose#6003 on discord.
1. Go to Device Manager and click the dropdown for Sound, Video and Game Controllers
2. Right click Senary drivers -> uninstall -> check the box that says something about deleting the driver software, Continue. 
3. Reboot once the drivers are uninstalled.
4. Upon your next boot, you'll have the Windows HD audio drivers installed instead of the Senary drivers.

# Unlock higher than 28W TDP
1. <b>DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK </b>
2. Go to bios by pressing del key during start up process
3. While in bios menu, press ALT+F5 to access the hidden menu
4. Navigate to the following path Second Advance-> AMD CBS-> SMU Common Options
5. Change the values as follow or to the TDP you want, value is in mW
![SMU](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74781086/206560019-c329382d-0c79-4d82-806b-961e97c2f3cc.jpg)
6. Go to the SmartShift Control menu, and set it as follow
